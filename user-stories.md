#As A Gameplayer I want:

## UI:
A UI that is easy and intuitive to navigate.
A UI that is pleasing visually.
 
##UX:
A game that is challenging to play, but not so challenging as to inspire a rage-quit.
The ability to track my high-scores and show-off to friends.

# As I designer I want:
Honestly, my biggest goal is to pass the class!
A game that shows off my technial proficiency.
A game that levels indefinitely, to keep players hooked as long as possible.
A final product that I'd be excited to show off to potential future employers, as well as my friends!
