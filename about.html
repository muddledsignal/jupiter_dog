                            <!-- description -->
                            <p>I immigrated from Iran to the US about 7 years ago not knowing how to speak English. I worked at one of the top 5 architecture firms in the US, ZGF. At the same time I got my M.S. degree in Engineering and Technology Management (ETM) from PSU. (It's ETM not ATM, I don't have money to give out) 
I've always thought about how to utilize my creative background and M.S. degree, and I think Code Fellows can be a place for me to build some skills in Program Development and hopefully I can get my foot in at a high tech company and work in its creative department.</p>

                            <p>After working for a few years in retail and customer service, I wanted to do something more challenging and build a career for myself. That brought me to Code Fellows, where I'm studying to become a full-stack JavaScript developer. Once I've finished the course, I hope to find the opportunity to put my new skillset to use at a company that values people as much as I do.</p>

                            <p>My name is Paul Suarez and I'm a Sales Manager for AT&amp;T. I spent a few years working on my Computer Science degree and unfortunately had to put that on hold due to some life events. I decided to join Code Fellows because I wanted to merge my passion for sales with my passion for technology and Code Fellows can help me achieveÂ this goal in a fraction of the time.</p>

                            <p>'Sup.  I'm Travis, although if you've played the game already you probably know me as Sherlock, on account of my immensely cool trenchcoat.  I don't get out much, sticking mostly to back-end work where I get to use my love of problem-solving, abstract-thinking and math (yes, I like math.  Yes, I know you don't like me anymore.) to solve cool puzzles... like why the heck the entire game broke.  Again.  [It was probably my fault].  I was a physics major and a math minor in college.  Like many of my classmates, I made the switch to coding after realizing belatedly that nobody hires physics majors for anything.  But I'm a coder now, so hit me up and pay me da moneyz!</p>
